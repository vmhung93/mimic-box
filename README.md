# Mimic Box WebSocket (Browser Tool)

This is a standalone HTML file that functions as a feature-rich WebSocket client specifically designed for testing services that use **CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation)** for data transfer and require **JWT token authentication**. It includes built-in message logging, token censoring, and an automated response mechanism.

## ðŸš€ Features

  * **Standalone:** All code (HTML, CSS/Tailwind, and JavaScript) is contained within a single `mimic box.html` file.
  * **CBOR Support:** Includes a custom JavaScript implementation for encoding and decoding CBOR messages, allowing for binary communication over the WebSocket.
